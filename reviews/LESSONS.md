# Lessons and rule changes

The running record of what paper results have shown and why each rulebook version exists. Newest first. Each review adds an entry; a rule only changes when the data here supports it.

## How to review (instructions for each review session)

1. Run `python3 -m bot.report` and read `data/STATUS.md` and the latest `data/runs/*.jsonl` errors.
2. First check the bot is healthy: runs arriving, no repeated errors, `batch_miss` low, signals appearing. Fix plumbing before judging strategy.
3. Judge the current rulebook version only on its own trades. Under about 30 closed trades, treat every pattern as a hint, not a finding.
4. Look for: which exit reasons lose the most, which entry features separate winners from losers, how much gain was left on the table, and which funnel stage blocks the most candidates.
5. Change at most one rulebook section per review, bump `version`, and write the entry below: what the data showed, what changed, and what result would prove the change wrong.
6. Never loosen a safety rule to get more trades. Never tune to hit a return target.
7. Once a version looks good, stop changing it: the proof gate needs 100+ trades on one frozen version.

## Log

### v2, 2026-11-13: wider discovery (trading rules unchanged)

First live run (13:43 UTC) parsed the DexScreener API cleanly: no errors, SOL price derived, 158 of 160 discovered tokens returned data. Finding: DexScreener's boost, profile, takeover and meta feeds are a poor source for our universe. Of 160 tokens, 86 had under $30k liquidity, 66 were older than 35 days, 4 were under 3 days old, and only 1 was in the tradable band (it failed the buy-pressure test). At that rate 10 trades a day is impossible.

Change: added GeckoTerminal trending and most-traded Solana pools as a discovery source (pre-filtered to pools with at least $30k reserve and at most 35 days old). Prices and decisions still come from DexScreener.

Would prove it wrong: if after a day the tradable universe (funnel `universe_ok`) is still under about 10 tokens per run, discovery is still the bottleneck and needs another source. Second live run (13:52 UTC) confirmed GeckoTerminal parsing: 33 tokens discovered, tradable universe rose from 1 to 6, with 14 more under 3 days old waiting to age in. GeckoTerminal returned HTTP 429 on the 10th call, so calls are now spaced 6.5s and pages cut to 9 per cycle (plumbing fix, no version bump). Six tokens were rejected for an unlisted quote token; the funnel now records which. Third live run (14:18 UTC): GeckoTerminal still returned 429 on the 6th call at 6.5s spacing, so the bot now fetches 2 pages per cycle and rotates through 9 pages (each refreshed about every 25 minutes). The unlisted quote tokens were AMD, NVDAX, TTWO, STONK and WBTC (tokenized-stock and other exotic pairs): correctly excluded, no change. GitHub never started the 5-minute timer in 45 minutes, so the workflow now runs 50-minute sessions that loop every 5 minutes and restart themselves; pushing a change to `.kick` starts a session if the chain ever stops. Not yet verified live: RugCheck handling (only called when an entry signal fires; check `data/debug/rugcheck_sample.json` and run errors).

### v1, 2026-11-13: starting hypotheses

No data yet. Thresholds are guesses based on the agreed approach: established tokens (3 to 30 days), real liquidity, safety-screened, moderate momentum entries, tight risk per trade. First job of the first reviews is to confirm the bot's data plumbing against the live API, which could not be tested before launch.
